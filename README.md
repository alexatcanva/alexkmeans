# K Means Clustering Practice

This is a repo where I've attempted to use the Kmeans clustering method to create a colour palette from an image.

Examples: 

Input image like so :
![alt text](/assets/example_three.png) 

Output image like so :
![alt text](test.png)

Usage:
`kmeans -input assets/example_three.png -output test`

I learned this by reading the wikipedia article here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering
